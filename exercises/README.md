# Exercises: Managing Context in Claude Code

These guides turn the lesson in [docs/context-management.md](../docs/context-management.md) into hands-on practice you can run inside this project. Work through them in order. Each one takes only a few minutes, and together they cover the full lesson.

## Before you start
- Complete the installation steps in the root [README](../README.md), so `pytest` passes.
- Claude Code installed and running. The `claude` command should work in your terminal.
- Launch Claude Code from the project root:

```bash
cd context-management-for-ml-engineers
claude
```

- Be ready to run `/context` several times. You will use it to watch the numbers move as you work.

## How to use these guides
Each guide follows the same shape:

- **Goal**: the single idea you are practicing.
- **Steps**: what to type, in order.
- **Prompt**: the exact text to send, shown in a code block so you can copy it.
- **What to observe**: what should change on screen.
- **What to look for in the code**: where relevant, the files that explain the result.
- **Outcome**: what you should walk away understanding.

Run the guides in this order:

1. [Check your starting context](01-check-your-starting-context.md)
2. [Fill the context with real work](02-fill-the-context-with-real-work.md)
3. [Compact to keep going](03-compact-to-keep-going.md)
4. [Clear before an unrelated task](04-clear-before-an-unrelated-task.md)
5. [Persist what should survive](05-persist-what-should-survive.md)
6. [Save context space](06-save-context-space.md)

## Key takeaways
- Context is finite working memory. Every prompt you send, every file Claude reads, and every command result takes up a slice of it.
- `/context` shows how full the window is and which categories consume the most space. Check it when things feel sluggish or before a big task.
- `/compact` summarizes the conversation so far and keeps the summary, freeing space while preserving a memory of what you were doing.
- `/clear` wipes the session entirely for a clean start. Your `CLAUDE.md` stays loaded.
- Reach for `/compact` when you are staying on the same feature near the limit. Reach for `/clear` when you move to unrelated work and do not want the old conversation to bias it.
- Persist anything durable in `CLAUDE.md` so it survives both compaction and clearing.
- Save space by being specific, by turning off MCP servers you do not need, and by delegating lookups to subagents.
- Treat context like working memory. Keep it lean, and Claude works better.

## A note on the sample code
The code under `src/` is intentionally small and simplified so it is quick to read. It exists as material to explore while you practice these commands. Treat it as read-only for these exercises, and leave any comment that marks something as intentional exactly as written. See the note on intentional simplifications in the root `README.md`.
