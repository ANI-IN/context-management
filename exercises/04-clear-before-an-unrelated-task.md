# Exercise 4: Clear Before an Unrelated Task

## Goal
Start completely fresh when you switch to unrelated work, so the previous conversation does not bias the new task.

## Context
Imagine you are done with the prediction flow and are switching to something completely different, such as the API key check in `src/sentiment_app/auth/`. You do not want the prediction exploration influencing the new work.

## Steps
1. Wipe the session:

```
/clear
```

2. Check the window:

```
/context
```

## What to observe
The session is wiped. Your `CLAUDE.md` remains loaded, so project conventions survive, but the prediction conversation is gone. When you run `/context`, usage is back near the baseline you saw in Exercise 1.

## Compact or clear: how to choose
- Use `/compact` when you are staying on the same feature and need to continue near the limit. It keeps a summary.
- Use `/clear` when you move to unrelated work and want no memory of the previous session. It keeps nothing from the conversation.

Choosing `/compact` when you meant to `/clear` is a common mistake. If a new task feels biased by old work, you probably compacted when you should have cleared.

## Outcome
You can reset to a clean slate on demand, and you know when clearing beats compacting.
